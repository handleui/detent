## Deployment Options

| Option | Best For | Complexity |
|--------|----------|------------|
| [Docker Compose](/self-hosting/docker-compose) | Small teams, development | Low |
| [Kubernetes](/self-hosting/kubernetes) | Production, scalability | Medium |
| Cloudflare Workers | Edge deployment, global scale | Low |

## Requirements

### Minimum Hardware

- **CPU**: 2 cores
- **RAM**: 4 GB
- **Storage**: 20 GB SSD

### Software Dependencies

- PostgreSQL 15+ (or compatible like Neon, Supabase)
- Redis (or Upstash for serverless)
- Node.js 20+ (for CLI)
- Docker (for containerized deployment)

### External Services

| Service | Purpose | Self-Hosted Alternative |
|---------|---------|------------------------|
| WorkOS | User authentication | - |
| GitHub App | GitHub integration | GitHub Enterprise Server |
| GitLab | GitLab integration | GitLab Self-Managed |

## Quick Start

For a quick local setup:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/handleui/detent
cd detent

# Start PostgreSQL
cd apps/api
docker compose up -d

# Apply migrations
bun run db:migrate

# Start the API (development)
bun run dev
```
