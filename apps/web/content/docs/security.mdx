description: How detent releases are secured
---

Detent takes supply chain security seriously. Every release is cryptographically signed and verified.

## How releases are secured

### Checksum verification

Every binary download is verified against SHA-256 checksums before installation. The install script automatically:

1. Downloads the binary archive
2. Downloads `checksums.txt`
3. Verifies the archive matches its checksum
4. Only then extracts and installs

If checksums don't match, installation is aborted.

### Cosign signatures (keyless)

All releases are signed using [Sigstore Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/) with keyless signing via GitHub Actions OIDC.

This means:
- No private keys to manage or leak
- Signatures are tied to the GitHub Actions workflow identity
- All signatures are recorded in a public transparency log (Rekor)

## Manual verification

For security-critical environments, you can manually verify releases:

### Verify checksums

```bash
# Download the release files
wget https://detent.sh/api/binaries/v1.0.0/dt-linux-amd64.tar.gz
wget https://detent.sh/api/binaries/v1.0.0/checksums.txt

# Verify
sha256sum -c checksums.txt --ignore-missing
```

### Verify cosign signature

```bash
# Download signature files
wget https://detent.sh/api/binaries/v1.0.0/checksums.txt.sig
wget https://detent.sh/api/binaries/v1.0.0/checksums.txt.pem

# Verify with cosign
cosign verify-blob \
  --certificate checksums.txt.pem \
  --signature checksums.txt.sig \
  --certificate-identity 'https://github.com/detent/cli/.github/workflows/build.yml@refs/tags/v1.0.0' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer 'https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com' \
  checksums.txt
```

Replace `v1.0.0` with your target version.

## Reporting vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by emailing security@detent.sh or help@detent.sh. You can also open a private security advisory on GitHub.
